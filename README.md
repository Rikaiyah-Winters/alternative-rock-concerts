When starting this project, I wanted to choose a subject that interested me, so I ultimately chose the Alternative Rock Concerts JSON file that Algolia provided. I intended to make a simple search UI to find alternative rock concerts based on band name, date of concert, venue, and location. Users can use the search bar to type in key letters/words or numbers to search for a particular concert. If those key words or numbers match up to any of the attributes in the file, the number of 'hits' in the right panel and the refinement list on the left panel will begin to narrow down to what the user is looking for.
One piece of feedback to Algolia is to create more clear instructions or turorials on how to install and work with the needed softwares like an nvm and npx. The most difficult and time consuming part of this project was learning which softwares to download.
